# Temperature Converter

In this repository you can find a Temperature Converter built in Rust. 

Using this tool you will be able to convert any desired temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

This is my first Rust project :)

## Understanding the tool 👨‍💻

After downloading the main file, you can type `cargo run` in your terminal. It will run the code and ask for the user's inputs.

The first input must be the letter `F` if you want to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius or the letter `C` if you want to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Any other letter will not trigger the next step, lowercase C or F will lead to the next step as well.

The second input is a number, which is the temperature value. You can type any numeric value you want, including decimals.

After confirming the second input, the software will return the converted temperature!

## Thanks 😄

Thanks for reading my code! This is my first Rust project and I'm enjoying a lot to learn Rust using the [Rust Book](https://github.com/rust-lang/book).
